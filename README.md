# This project looks weird...
You can trust me, that was a really fun project to make. In German Lesson, as a Final Task, we had to make a flyer to promote some ecologists actions.
There were just a little problem. I wanted to make something better than only a paper with some text and some pasting on it. So I decided to create a webpage, and my teacher agreed with this. I had no Idea about the theme, but hopefully, my friend CÃ©lian told me about Earth-Chan.

# So, Earth-Chan, what does it means?
Earth-Chan is the embodiment of the Earth. Our idea was to make people feeling compassion for Earth-Chan, by saying that if we continue to contaminate the Earth, she will suffer. That was a cool idea, then we did this webpage within 2 days.

# This little project is now closed...
... and that, for a long, very long moment. I'll probably never modify again what I have done. So, we can say that this project is finished, and it is already so cool, that I don't need to add something else.
